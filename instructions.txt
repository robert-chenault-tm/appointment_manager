The application uses a MySQL database.
In the chenaurj.appointment_manager.config package, the JdbcConfig class contains the connection info.
Change the setUrl, setUsername, and setPassword methods to take in the appropriate connection info for the database you will be using.

The application only needs one table in the database which can be created with the following SQL:
CREATE TABLE `appointment` (
  `id` varchar(36) NOT NULL,
  `time` datetime NOT NULL,
  `description` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
)

Put the application on a server and browse to localhost:portnumber/appointment_manager, for example localhost:8080/appointment_manager when using a tomcat server with default settings.
